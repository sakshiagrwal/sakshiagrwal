## Hello everyone! :wave:

My name is Sakshi and I am passionate about solving problems using programming. :computer:

<br/> :purple_heart: &nbsp; I'm a 1st year computer science student from Bengaluru, India with a passion for coding and learning new technologies. I'm currently pursuing an internship to gain hands-on experience and boost my skills.

I have a focus on efficient and creative problem-solving, and I strive to create innovative solutions in my projects. I believe that through continuous learning and experimentation, I can achieve my goals.

My GitHub profile is where I share my projects and learning experiences. I welcome collaborations and feedback on my work. So, feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me.
